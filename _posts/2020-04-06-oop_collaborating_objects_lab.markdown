This lab was a duesy. It took me 3 days to pass all the tests. I understand how each file and class connects with each other it was just hard getting the tests to pass and understanding why I was getting certain errors when my code was correct. 

I eventually reached out for help and am currently in the process getting the error figured out. We know my code is correct we are just wondering why its returning a string instead of the Artist object. 

Currently I'm having someone look at my repo to figure out what's wrong. Hopefully I can get all the tests to pass.
