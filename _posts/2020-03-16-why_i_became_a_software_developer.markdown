I became a Software Developer because I fell in love with the fact that you can make anything your mind comes up with. 
The fact that there's so many companies, family owned business that rely on word of mouth and Facebook drives me to want to help those business get more business with the added aspect of a website. On the other hand I love the fact that anything that's already running and working is never finished. 

The fact that one day is different from another excites me. Or the fact that you can go from project to project depending where you work. 

I enjoy creating something from nothing.
